def: "A delay in the achievement of motor or mental milestones in the domains of development of a child, including motor skills, speech and language, cognitive skills, and social and emotional skills. This term should only be used to describe children younger than five years of age." [DDD:hvfirth, HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Developmental retardation is any significant lag in development in the any or all of the physical, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social spheres. Note that the term intellectual disability (mental retardation) refers to not merely a delay in development but rather a permanent limitation. Note that the term 'psychomotor retardation' is also used in some contexts to refer to a slowing of thought and physical movements as a result of major depression or intoxication.

For instance, at the age of 3 months, a child smiles in response to social interaction, at the age of 7 months, a child responds to the facial expressions of others, and at the age of 12 months a child is shy around strangers.
